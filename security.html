          <h2>1. AML policy</h2>
          <p>
            Betatransfer company (the "Company") implements the AML and KYC Policy (the "Policy"). The goal is to prevent illegal activities in the financial sphere and to promote compliance with the norms of international agreements adopted in recent years. The Policy implementation goes through a procedure designed to identify the Client.
          </p>

          <p>
            The AML provision and KYC policies are posted on the pages of this resource and are contained in other agreements with the Client. They take effect with the adoption of the General Agreement.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Terminology is used when explaining the Policy.</li>
            <li>The Policy has the following terms:</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The Policy is a set of measures aimed at preventing the legalization of income obtained illegally (through participation in criminal activities, shadow economy) to prevent or at least reduce the possible risks that the Company will become involved in this type of activity. Globally, the Policy is a powerful interstate mechanism. It is not only preventing the operation of financial "laundries" but also increasing barriers that will prevent the support of terrorists and the creation of weapons capable of mass harm to the population.</p>

          <p>
            KYC is a procedure requiring financial institutions to find out who their customers are. Legally compliant institutions, acting solely within the legal framework, are instructed not to conduct transactions unless the persons involved are identified.
          </p>

          <p>
            CIP is a program administered under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Justice. The terms of the CIP require the financial companies to identify the person interested in cooperating before offering their services.
          </p>

          <p>
            A client is an individual or entity who intends to receive, uses, has used, has previously used, or is involved in any way with the Company's services as a family member, a beneficial owner (ultimate beneficiary), employee, the officer of the Client's company, etc.
          </p>

          <p>Prohibited conduct is unlawful that shows signs of acts in the financial sphere that the legislation recognizes as illegal.</p>

          <p>Fraud is deception with selfish purposes and abuse of trust which causes damage to other persons and the Company.</p>
          <p>Corruption is the actions of an employee or official manifesting in unlawful offers, extortion, and various forms of pressure on another party to obtain certain privileges or access to something of value.</p>
          <p>Money laundering is carrying out financial transactions with money, or property that has an illegal origin with the purpose to hide the identity of the owner, source, or recipient of the money to make them look lawful.</p>
          <p>Collusion is a secret agreement to gain an advantage by exerting undue influence and infringing upon the rights and interests of third parties, including the Company.</p>
          <p>Terrorism Financing is the support, in one way or another, that facilitates terrorist activity in various forms.</p>
          <p>Criminal behavior is knowingly unlawful behavior that poses a threat to society.</p>
          <p>An Authorized Fraud Control Officer (hereinafter referred to as the "Authorized Person") is a person with the authority to monitor and prevent fraud and to conduct investigations, if necessary, to detect Prohibited Conduct. The Authorized Person is directly responsible for ensuring that actions against persons suspected of fraudulent, unlawful conduct are properly enforced.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The terms cited are also used in third-party links on the Betatransfer website.</li>
            <li>The meaning of terms not cited in the Policy is      disclosed in the General Agreement.</li>
            <li>The Policy is implemented by the Company and its      representatives.</li>
            <li>When stating the Policy, the Company may use      references to its services and other resources in which its intellectual      property is invested.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Legal basis</h2>

          <h3>2.1 The legal basis for the Policy is the regulations that have been enacted by the UK and FATF recommendations, including:</h3>

          <p>2.1.1. The UK Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act. The Act was based on Directives 2005/60/EC and 2006/70/EC, which were adopted by the European Union. The requirements of the directives have been reviewed and adapted to fit the national legislation, supplemented by provisions adapted to the particularities of national law. The law regulates how to prevent attempts to legalize funds acquired in circumvention of applicable law to finance terrorist activities. It is defined the subjects of the law and what duties, rights, and responsibilities the subjects have.</p>
          <p>2.1.2. "Regulatory Rules for Customer Due Diligence" approved by the Financial and Capital Market Commission of Great Britain in 2008 under No. 125. They were adopted to apply the above-mentioned law. The Rules define the cases when financial institutions are supposed to take measures to obtain additional information about their clients. It is established in what order and with what minimum requirements such procedures are to be carried out. The categories of risk that arise when funds obtained by illegal means are legalized, and terrorism is financially supported are highlighted. The risk attributes for each of the categories, the special measures to obtain a better understanding of the customers, and the procedures to apply enhanced supervision, which is also to be applied to the customers' transactions, are specified.</p>
          <p>2.1.3. Directive (EU) 2015/849. It was adopted in 2015 by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe to prevent European financial institutions and the financial system from being used by money launderers and terrorist financiers.</p>
          <p>2.1.4. The 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</p>
          <p>2.1.5. The 40 Recommendations of the FATF.</p>
          <p>2.1.6. Other international instruments and agreements set forth regulatory measures aimed at preventing money laundering and the financial support of terrorists.</p>
